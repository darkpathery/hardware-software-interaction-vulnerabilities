# hardware-software-interaction-vulnerabilities
The idea of using software to affect electrical pulses at a very low level

# Purpose
This project explores a unique approach to manipulating hardware through software interactions, particularly focusing on creating complex, multi-layered binary patterns to stress and potentially disrupt hardware behavior. The goal is to examine how complex data structures, when processed by the system, could lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior due to the hardware struggling to manage this new type of data interaction.

# idea
The core idea is to take traditional binary data (0s and 1s) and stack them into multiple layers—a "third-dimensional" representation of binary information. This creates a multi-layered data structure that adds complexity, making it more difficult for the system to process and interpret correctly.

The layers are stacked in a way that represents multiple binary rows, creating an overload of data that could:

1. Stress the hardware by forcing it to manage more complex data.
2. Potentially cause timing issues, power fluctuations, or errors as the system tries to decode the data.
3. Be used as a technique to explore hardware vulnerabilities and bypass security checks by complicating the way hardware interacts with binary data.

# How It Works
# Example of Stacked Binary Data

Layer 1:  010101

Layer 2:  110011

Layer 3:  001100


Layer 4:  101010

Layer 5:  010010

Layer 6:  111000

in this example:

* Layer 1 to Layer 3 represent the first set of binary data.
* Layer 4 to Layer 6 represent the second set of binary data.

The data is stacked into multiple layers to introduce complexity. A system that processes this data might struggle to interpret it as a simple, linear sequence, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
Layer 6:  111000

# Potential Applications
Vulnerability Research: Investigating how systems handle complex, multi-layered data structures and whether these can introduce new weaknesses.
Hardware Stress Testing: Pushing hardware components to their limits to observe how they behave under complex data loads.
Obfuscation Techniques: Using multi-layered binary data to complicate static analysis or reverse engineering efforts.


## How to Run

To compile and run the C program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2. Install a C compiler (if you don’t have one already). On Linux, you can install GCC using the following command
   
  sudo apt install build-essential   # For Ubuntu/Debian

  On macOS, you can install Xcode Command Line Tools

  xcode-select --install
  
3. Compile the C program: Use the gcc compiler to compile the C code. For example

   gcc -o stress_test stress_test.c
   
This command will generate an executable file called stress_test.

4. Run the program: Execute the compiled program

./stress_test

# Dependencies

C Compiler: The program requires a C compiler like GCC or Clang to compile the source code.

Standard C Library: This program uses functions from the standard C library (stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h, etc.), so no additional dependencies are required.

# Expected Output

When you run the program, it will output the following:

1.System Info: The program will detect and display the number of CPU cores and the system’s total memory (RAM)

Detected 4 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM.

2.Stress Test Configuration: Based on the system specs (CPU cores and memory), it will show the number of layers and the size of each binary layer:

Adjusting stress test: 100 layers, each 2000 bits of data, complexity 0.

3.System Stress: The program will then simulate stress by generating binary layers and performing calculations (with random or alternating binary patterns). The system's CPU will be utilized for these operations, and you may notice a slight increase in CPU usage.

# Notes

Low-Spec Systems: If you are running the program on a system with low memory (e.g., 4GB or less), the stress test will involve simpler binary patterns and fewer layers to avoid overwhelming the system.
High-Spec Systems: If you are running the program on a high-spec system (e.g., 8GB or more RAM), the program will generate more complex binary patterns and perform more operations to stress the system further.

# future goals
1. Refinement of Layer Encoding: Explore various methods to structure these layers and observe how they interact with different hardware components.
2. Stress Testing Tools: Develop tools to automate the creation and testing of these complex data layers on hardware, specifically targeting vulnerabilities and 
   performance issues.
